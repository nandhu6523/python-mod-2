## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - POWER OF A NUMBER 

### AIM  
To write a Python program to compute the power of the given number using appropriate built -in function . 

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Input two numbers x and y.
3. Calculate z = x raised to the power y (z = x^y).
4. Print z as the power of the given number.
5. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```

x=int(input())
y=int(input())
z=pow(x,y)
print("Power of the given number is:",z)

```

### OUTPUT
